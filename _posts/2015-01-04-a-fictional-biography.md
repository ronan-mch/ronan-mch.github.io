Chris Baglieri has [an interesting idea](http://www.chrisbaglieri.com/blog/2015/1/1/my-resume-is-fiction) - every year he creates a fictional resum√© made up of all the things he'd like to have on his CV, then spends the rest of the year trying to make it true. A neat little self motivation ritual. But also limited - should self-improvement really centre around our work lives? Sure, work is important, but it's not the only thing in our lives or in who we're trying to be as people. So what about a fictional biography that covers all the bases? Perhaps more suitable would be a fictional summary of the coming year divided into all the sections that are important to us (e.g. parenting, relationships, work, music etc.)? Not as pithy as a CV, but life is about more than acquiring skills for the job market.

*NOTE - I'm sure that Chris isn't implying that work is the most important thing in life - I just like the idea and want to apply to something else with the help of a little bit of hyperbole. Sorry Chris!*
