Last book by the delightful and much missed Iain (M.) Banks. Very exciting book. Only major downside was the weakness of the second main character (Guy) who seemed half-written. I liked the structure of the novel, centred around the main character's encounter with his Dad and his friends' mutual history propelled along by Guy's slow death from cancer. 

The friends' encounter is by turns joyful and miserable as they reflect on their student days and their divergent paths since. All the while they search for a tape of a student film that threatens to expose their youthful indiscretions.

**Rating 4.5/5**
