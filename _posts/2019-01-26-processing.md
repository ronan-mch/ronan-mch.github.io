title:  "Processing"

I've been playing with Processing recently. It's a really cool tool for graphical programming developed at the intersection between art and technology. It's been around for quite a while and the developers have done a great job of making it accessible and easy to pick up. The documentation is first class and I've been really enjoying Adam Shiffman's [The Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/) book which demonstrates how to use Processing to model various phenomena including motion and artificial life.
