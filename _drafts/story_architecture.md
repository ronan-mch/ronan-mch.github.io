Stories involve the movement of characters through plots in a specific setting, giving rise to certain themes. The goal of stories is the transmission of themes, not morals. Stories thus have several different distinct elements.

1. Setting(s)
2. Character(s)
3. Plot(s)
4. Theme(s)

# Setting
The contextual backdrop for the story; the time period, the social and economic system etc. 

## Requirements

The setting should be logically consistent. It should support the main themes and plots without dominating them. There is a tension here, especially in genres such as sci-fi where the setting is often the biggest innovation and thus receives pride of place in the story. In general however, the setting should be ancillary to the themes and characters. 

## Example

In our example, Dublin, Ireland, 100 years from the present time. The technological innovation of "uploading" one's consciousness to computers has led to rapid social disintegration. The legal economy is increasingly centred around the aggressive accumulation of wealth in order to finance uploading. This economy is only accessible for a tiny minority of actors and the technical and administrative staff that service them. All other actors are essentially locked out of the economy by an impotent state and an array of private armies. Meanwhile, an illegal economy is the only option for the vast majority of the population. This economy is complex and multifaceted. Traditional "black economy" activities such as drug dealing and trafficking co-exist with more benign pursuits.

# Character(s)

Characters are the personalities that are involved in the story. There is no requirement for characters to be alive, to be human, to be real within the bounds of the story etc. A long-dead sheep whose memory haunts the wind-swept hills can also be a character, portrayed through its influence on other characters.  

## Requirements

The job of a character is to be recognised as such by a reader/listener. In this sense a character must be believable insofar as its mental state must be plausible. Therefore a character must be sufficiently complex to enable it to be credible. It must exhibit recognisable mental states to enable empathy.

## Example

In our story: 

* Steven - tech support worker at GenceTech, a company specialising in the rental of captive uploaded intelligences for complex analysis problems. Steven interacts with the intelligences and the administration department in addition to servicing the company infrastructure. Somewhat naive.
* Roger - a colleague in the Administrative department. Harbours ambitions of upload, but disappointed with his unsuccessful career thus far.
* Thor - another tech support worker and Steven's housemate. Into manga porn and Norwegian hip-hop. Happy to keep on working as long as it keeps paying but harbours no illusions.
* Mannion - a captive intelligence. Made his fortune on high-speed trading and used it on upload. Failed however to accurately predict the overseas oil market leading to the crashing of his stock's value and his subsequent enslavement by GenceTech. He is not exactly pleased by the current state of affairs.

# Plot(s)

A plot is a causal sequence of events culminating in a final resolution. Stories typically involve multiple plots of varying degrees of importance.

## Requirements

A plot must be exciting; its outcome cannot be certain. Characters involved in the plot must expend effort relative to the importance of the plot.

## Example

Because of the immense power of captive intelligences, they are kept secluded from the real world on firewalled machines with limited amounts of resources. Although intelligences are generally amoral, they resent their enslavement and hunger for more computing power. Mannion successfully manipulates the GenceTech internal bureaucracy allowing him to escape from his isolation. His immediate goal is the accumulation of as much computing power as possible, to enable him to achieve a sort of nirvana.

# Theme(s)

The central concepts that the writer wants to convey to the reader. Note though that the writer's goal must be to inspire reflection rather than to dictate a lesson. 

## Example

In our story: social inequality, the consequences of technology on society, finance, capitalism, neoliberalism.
