        <h2>A Love Supreme</h2>
        <p>
          It was cold for summer. The long evening was over and the city was slipping slowly into the shadow of night. Wind gusted fitfully down the narrow street, whipping cool droplets of rain before it. An empty can rattled down the footpath, before coming to rest in the hollow of a drain. Christie turned up his collar and leaned back into the shelter of the door, his eyes scanning lazily from side to side. Not many on the streets now. A bad night for a gig he'd thought, but people had been trickling in all night. The place was packed and the main act hadn't even started yet.

          Down by the arcade he could see a couple winding their way from beneath the redbrick facade of the dressmaker's, now draped in black. Behind them the street was almost empty, a single taxi drove by them slowly, hoping in vain for a fare.

          Christie looked at his watch, nearly eleven, another few hours before he could head home. Normally he wouldnâ€™t work on a Tuesday, but he couldn't say no, not when the other job had ended the way it had. Lucky this fellow hadn't heard about that. Different circles he guessed but it was a small town, word gets around sooner or later. Experience or not, there was plenty of people out there who could do this job.

          The couple neared the door and Christie stood up straight to survey them. The man was short with greasy hair, shirt and jacket, no tie. The woman was blonde, taller than the fellow with her heels on; a nice dress and a necklace. He pushed the door back and they walked past him, the man nodding mutely as he passed, the woman staring straight ahead into the foyer. The noise of the crowd bulged out onto the street before fading again as the door swung shut. An interval so, the main band would be starting soon. A few punters filed out onto the street to huddle over their cigarettes for a few focused moments before returning to the warmth inside.

        <p>
          The rain was beginning to pick up and Christie decided to move in as well, there wouldn't be many more coming now. He pushed open the door and stepped inside. The foyer was dark and warm, with a low ceiling and a thick carpet. The girl behind the ticket desk glanced at him briefly before looking away. The double doors into the hall were half open and he could hear clumsy thumps and murmurs as the techs set up the gear. The crowd was subdued, but he could hear the anticipation building in the room.
        </p>
        <p>
          A few minutes and they started to quiet, as if someone had suddenly turned their volume down. A ripple of applause as the band comes on stage followed by curt echoes and adjustments to mikes and instruments. The gong of a cymbal cuts through the room, a deep brass growl that sets Christie's hair on edge. A saxophone breaks in, a skittering tumble of notes that never quite forms into a melody while the piano stabs chords beneath it. A moment and it's gone again and the brass growl has turned into a steaming hiss of taps and bells. A new rhythm now, a four note tattoo, soft and lazy, but insistent. There's a beat and the piano's back with it, holding down chords for a second at a time, like steps climbing up a cloud, that disappear after a moment and reappear further up. That's when the sax came back, barking and haranguing and pulling the other voices together into a great storm of howling wind and tossing rhythm. Christie is adrift, caught in the eye of it. It builds and subsides, gathering force and losing it again, all the time carrying him with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          An age goes by, or a moment, and Christie realises that the storm has passed, leaving only the thrums and pulls of the bass. Behind the ticket desk the girl is looking at him strangely now and he turns and walks out again into the dark.
